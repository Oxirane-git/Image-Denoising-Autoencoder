# Image-Denoising-Autoencoder
This project implements a deep learning pipeline in PyTorch for denoising grayscale document images (like scanned IDs, licenses, etc.) using an autoencoder architecture inspired by U-Net and enhanced with residual blocks. The goal is to remove noise and restore clean document images for improved readability and OCR performance.
